PROBE 2026 defines a set of real-world problems that challenge ontology-driven reasoning over real-world process data.
Every challenge problem is from a real-world industrial use case, using publicly available industrial data, and real-world business questions. 
Several of the challenges are sourced from the [Business Process Intelligence Challenges (BPIC)](https://www.tf-pm.org/competitions-awards/bpi-challenge), widely used as benchmark datasets in various areas of process mining. 
The BPIC challenge problems have the benefit of published solution papers which contain several implicit ontological commitments, data interpretations, and anaylsis decisions which provide a wealth of motivating information and real-world usage patterns to base ontology applications on.

<Aside type="note" title="Work-in-Progress">
The challenges below are a work-in-progress. All have the necessary download information, and full descritpions of the challenge problems. 
Supplementary information, clarifications, and additional challenges will be added as this webpage is updated.
