title: Building Permit Application Process
description: Building permit application logs from five Dutch municipalities.
---

import ImplementationDisclaimer from '../../../components/ImplementationDisclaimer.astro';

This challenge provides real-life event logs from building permit applications across five Dutch municipalities over approximately four years.
The data covers both main application processes and objection/appeal procedures.

The data is split into five separate logs, one for each municipality, each labelled with a distinct letter (A,B,C,D,E).

The dataset contains building permit application events with rich attributes:

- **Activities:** Coded activities (e.g., `01_HOOFD_xxx` for main process, `01_BB_xxx` for objections/complaints) with both Dutch and English labels
- **Stages:** Multiple stages including main applications and objection procedures in various states
- **Resources:** Information on personnel involved in tasks
- **Costs:** Application costs captured (attribute SUMleges)
- **Multi-municipality:** Five municipalities represented, with potentially divergent processes due to timing of procedure changes and regulatory updates

## Challenge Questions

The municipalities are interested in addressing the following questions:

1. **Organizational Roles and Structures:** What are the roles of people involved in various process stages, and how do these roles differ across municipalities? Where are the organizational improvement opportunities for each municipality?

2. **Impact of Physical Colocation:** Two municipalities recently moved their employees into the same physical location. Did this lead to changes in their processes, and if so, what differs?

3. **Outsourcing Effects:** Some procedures will be outsourced from 2018 onwards (moved outside the process). What will be the effect of this on organizational structures in the five municipalities?

4. **Throughput Time Analysis:** Where are the differences in throughput times between municipalities, and how can these differences be explained? What are the differences in control flow between municipalities?

5. **Cross-Organizational Patterns:** Can you identify employees who worked across multiple municipalities? Do they show different behavior patterns?

## Implementation Considerations

<ImplementationDisclaimer />

1. **States vs. activities:** Status changes like `A_Submitted`, `A_Validating`, or `A_Accepted` can be modeled as events, but they also represent state phases. Treating them purely as instant activities can hide the duration of being “in” a state and affect throughput or waiting-time analysis.

2. **Application vs. offer lifecycles:** Application (`A_`) and Offer (`O_`) events can be interleaved into one case stream, but this flattens a one‑to‑many relationship. If offers have their own lifecycle, modeling only the application as the case can turn distinct offer threads into loops.

3. **Handover inference from sequence:** A simple A→B sequence can be treated as a handover, but the next event may be triggered by a timer, an external call, or a parallel task. Sequential ordering is not always causal transfer of work.

4. **System actor agency:** Including system users (e.g., `User_1`) in resource analysis treats automation as a peer actor. This can be useful, but it may distort human workload and collaboration metrics if not separated.

5. **Closed‑world throughput:** Measuring throughput as start‑to‑end duration treats all elapsed time as process time. This can conflate processing with waiting/queueing and may bias comparisons across municipalities with different staffing or queue policies.

6. **Complete vs. running cases:** If incomplete traces are retained, short or abandoned cases may look like fast completions. If they are removed, active work is excluded. Either choice changes outcome and performance statistics.
