title: Building Permit Application Process
description: Building permit application logs from five Dutch municipalities.
---

import ImplementationDisclaimer from '../../../components/ImplementationDisclaimer.astro';

This challenge provides real-life event logs from building permit applications across five Dutch municipalities over approximately four years.
The data covers both main application processes and objection/appeal procedures.

The data is split into five separate logs, one for each municipality, each labelled with a distinct letter (A,B,C,D,E).

The dataset contains building permit application events with rich attributes:

- **Activities:** Coded activities (e.g., `01_HOOFD_xxx` for main process, `01_BB_xxx` for objections/complaints) with both Dutch and English labels
- **Stages:** Multiple stages including main applications and objection procedures in various states
- **Resources:** Information on personnel involved in tasks
- **Costs:** Application costs captured (attribute SUMleges)
- **Multi-municipality:** Five municipalities represented, with potentially divergent processes due to timing of procedure changes and regulatory updates

## Challenge Questions

The municipalities are interested in addressing the following questions:

1. **Organizational Roles and Structures:** What are the roles of people involved in various process stages, and how do these roles differ across municipalities? Where are the organizational improvement opportunities for each municipality?

2. **Impact of Physical Colocation:** Two municipalities recently moved their employees into the same physical location. Did this lead to changes in their processes, and if so, what differs?

3. **Outsourcing Effects:** Some procedures will be outsourced from 2018 onwards (moved outside the process). What will be the effect of this on organizational structures in the five municipalities?

4. **Throughput Time Analysis:** Where are the differences in throughput times between municipalities, and how can these differences be explained? What are the differences in control flow between municipalities?

5. **Cross-Organizational Patterns:** Can you identify employees who worked across multiple municipalities? Do they show different behavior patterns?

## Implementation Considerations

<ImplementationDisclaimer />

1. **Phases as abstracted activitiy sequences:** To simplify the 356 unique activities in the raw data, the analysis may choose to only consider “phase-activities” (e.g., “phase - application received”). 
While these appear as events (since XES events are flexible and semantically heterogenous), they are also related to states or fluents. 
This motivates distinguishing the boundary event (phase change) from the phase segment itself.

2. **Temporal ordering via action codes over timestamps:** When timestamps are identical due to batching, sequencing can be imposed using action codes (e.g., `01_HOOFD_010`). 
This assumes the numeric code reflects the true process ordering, potentially masking concurrency or overlapping workflows.

3. **Mapping low-level activities to functional stages:** Low-level events can be mapped to phases using proximity and statistical metrics.
This presumes that events 'near' a phase marker are a valid part of that phase, rather than defining complex activities by the fluents/states they achieve.

4. **Definition of roles via statistical clustering:** Roles (e.g., administrators vs. decision-makers) may be inferred from activity patterns instead of formal organizational definitions.
This treats roles as behavioural dispositions rather than social or organizational positions.

5. **Treatment of ongoing vs. completed cases:** If completeness cannot be detected, analyses may keep all traces.
This mixes completed process occurrences with in-progress ones, which can skew throughput and outcome interpretations.

6. **Zero-duration event pairs:** Events in the same batch can yield zero durations.
This treats human activity as instantaneous and obscures the temporal extension needed for workload analysis.

7. **Resource utilization as a proxy for organizational health:** Treating higher utilization as “better” assumes purely quantitative capacity, overlooking qualitative factors like competence or authority that affect outcomes.
