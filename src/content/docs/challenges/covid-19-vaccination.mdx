import ImplementationDisclaimer from '../../../components/ImplementationDisclaimer.astro';

This challenge provides real-world COVID-19 vaccination data collected from multiple sources globally. The dataset combines daily and cumulative vaccination records from countries worldwide, alongside information on vaccination sources and vaccine manufacturers.

## Data Description

The dataset contains vaccination data with the following attributes:

- **Country Information:** Country name and ISO code
- **Date:** Daily entries tracking vaccination progress
- **Vaccination Metrics:** Total vaccinations, people vaccinated (partial), people fully vaccinated, with both absolute counts and per-capita ratios
- **Daily Data:** Raw and processed daily vaccination numbers with per-million ratios
- **Vaccination Scheme Information:** Details on vaccine types used in each country
- **Source Information:** Reporting sources (national authorities, international organizations, local organizations) and their websites
- **Manufacturer Data:** Breakdown of vaccinations by vaccine type and date

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Number of records | TBD |
| Unique event labels | TBD |
| Filesize | TBD |

## Challenge Questions

The challenge addresses the following key questions around data trustworthiness, comparative analysis, and temporal reasoning:

1. **Source Trustworthiness and Consistency:** How do different reporting sources differ in their vaccination data for the same countries and time periods? Which sources are most reliable and complete, and how can inconsistencies be reconciled?

2. **Vaccination Rate Comparisons:** How do vaccination rates compare across different countries, regions, and time periods? What factors explain variations in vaccination progress?

3. **Vaccination Scheme Ontology:** How can different national vaccination schemes (single-dose, two-dose, booster protocols) be accounted for in the data? How does this affect analysis and comparisons?

4. **Missing Data Handling:** How should missing vaccination data be handled and interpreted? Are there systematic patterns in missing data across sources or countries? What is the impact of incomplete reporting on analysis conclusions?

5. **Temporal Consistency:** How do reported vaccination numbers evolve over time, and are there revisions or corrections in historical data? How can these changes be tracked and explained ontologically?

6. **Seasonlity / Weekend Effect:** Is there a noticeable increase or decrease in vaccinations rate across the data, is a "weekend effect" more or less visible in certain countries compared to others?
