---

This challenge provides a real-life event log from a Dutch financial institute. The data covers the end-to-end process of applying for a loan through to the acceptance of a final offer.

## Challenge Questions
The company is particularly interested in addressing the following questions:

1. **Throughput Time Breakdown:** What are the throughput times per part of the process, in particular the difference between the time spent in the company's systems waiting for processing by a user and the time spent waiting on input from the applicant?
   
2. **Impact of Incompleteness:** What is the influence of the frequency of incompleteness on the final outcome? The hypothesis is that more requests for completion make applicants less likely to accept the final offer.
   
3. **Multiple Offers:** How many customers ask for more than one offer (single conversation vs. multiple conversations), and how does conversion compare between single-offer and multi-offer applicants?
