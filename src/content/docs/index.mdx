**PROBE 2026** is a challenge-based workshop focused on the **operational realization** of ontologies for process data.
We invite users of foundational and domain ontologies to challenge the expressive and applicative capabilities of their ontologies
on real-world process data and report how ontologies enable rigorous, data-driven reasoning and analysis.

<Aside type="tip" title="At-a-glance">
	Ontology-driven • Real-world data • Challenge-based

	PROBE 2026 centers on practical, reproducible ontology applications grounded in industrial process logs.
</Aside>

## Motivation

Many ontologies posses the theoretical expressiveness to represent complex process phenomena.
However, their application to real-world process data, including its messy, incomplete, and large-scale nature,
remains under-explored. PROBE 2026 aims to fill this gap by providing a curated set of real-world challenge problems that require
complex reasoning over industrial process data.

## Call for Papers

**Does your ontology work on real process data?** PROBE 2026 invites solution papers that apply foundational or domain ontologies to  solve real-world challenges centered around industrial process data.

### Topics of Interest

Submissions should tackle the application of some ontology(ies) to at least one of the [PROBE 2026 challenge problems](/challenges).
Submissions may focus on various topics around how ontologies can be operationalized for industrial process data analysis:

- **Semantic Heterogeneity:** Handling semantic heterogeneity of events in event logs (e.g., "Triage" as state vs activity)
- **Process Perspectives:** Ontology-driven process perspectives (e.g., formally representing abstraction, aggregation, decomposition of occurrences and events)
- **Ontology Comparison:** Ontology comparison (e.g., UFO vs BFO vs DOLCE on real-world process data)
- **Operational Realization:** Operational realization (e.g., OBDA, virtual knowledge graphs, semi-automated mappings)
- **Reasoning Mechanisms:** Reasoning mechanisms (e.g., ATPs, SMT, SPARQL, or others)

### Submission Types

- **Challenge Reports (5–12 pages):** Focus on a specific implementation, including ontology application choices, integration techniques, and results.
- **Extended Abstracts (2–5 pages):** High-level overview or preliminary findings on a challenge.

</Steps>

## Important Dates

<Steps>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Paper Submission — June 3, 2026:</strong> Workshop paper submission deadline</li>
		<li><strong>Author Notification — July 15, 2026:</strong> Notification of acceptance</li>
		<li><strong>Camera-Ready — July 31, 2026:</strong> Camera-ready submission deadline</li>

</Steps>

## Review Process

Submissions are reviewed based on:
- **Correctness**
- **Reproducibility**
- **Ontological transparency** (how the ontology was used to derive results)

Purely algorithmic solutions without explicit semantic modeling will be rejected.
We expect at least two reviews per paper.

## Workshop Format

<Steps>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Problem Overview:</strong> Chairs present the source datasets and motivating domain problems.</li>
		<li><strong>Solution Showcase:</strong> Authors present their ontology-driven solutions to the challenges.</li>
		<li><strong>Comparative Panel:</strong> Discussion comparing how different ontologies tackled the challenges.</li>
		<li><strong>Next Steps Panel:</strong> Identify new challenge problems and future directions.</li>
	</ol>
</Steps>

## Outcomes

The workshop will produce a comparative report on the **operational readiness** of current process ontologies, highlighting which commitments facilitate or hinder data-driven reasoning.

## Location & Contact

The workshop is co-located with FOIS 2026 as part of the joint ontology workshops (JOWO) and will take place in **Vitória, Brazil**.
